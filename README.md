# Improved Attack Timer
A plugin to show an attack cooldown timer.

The plugin will automatically start a timer on attack. Not all weapons may be
supported (YET!) - feel free to raise an issue in
[GitHub](https://github.com/Lexer747/improvedattacktimer/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=missing-weapon.md&title=Missing+Weapon)
if you find a weapon or special attack which doesn't work.

Ticks until next attack may be enabled over your player's head.

## Why is it improved?

* Fixed many powered staves auto attacks - previously incorrectly at 5 ticks
  * Accursed, Sang (with kit), Trident (e), Crystal Gauntlet staves
  * Harm now works properly, only 4 ticking on standards
* Adds Valarmore weapons (Perils of Moons/Tonalztics)
  * Also accounts for full blood moon set effect
* Adds a whole bunch of spec weapon support! Dscim, d2h, anchor - all the fun stuff üéâ
* You can 0-tick swap and the new weapon will be correctly used as the cooldown! Very helpful at Nylos üï∑Ô∏è
* Finally the most important - Salamanders are added :) üêç

### Testing

There's still work to do to bring this plugin up to perfect standards:

* Test Brine saber spec
* Nightmare staff specs (I don't own these weapons ATM)
* Dragon thrown axes, cool down resetting behavior

### Known issues

* rat weapons at Scurrius having no delay isn't accounted for
* 0 ticking weapons is now much better but there's still some edge cases involving casting magic - works
  better with game sounds on.

Every new game update needs a manual update with the new items, this isn't
sustainable - figure out a way to implement them without owning them. Or even
better simply picked up information from the client.
